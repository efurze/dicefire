	Your AI will run as Player 1 in a 3-player game. You can navigate to your AI code in your browser's developer tools. Go to the 'Sources' tab and look for the file 
	<br>
	<br>
	{{ai_path}}.js
	<br>
	<br>
	You can set breakpoints in that file. <b>Try it now!</b> Set a breakpoint in your 'startTurn' function <b>before</b> pressing the 'Go' button below, or the game will likely end before you can set a breakpoint.
